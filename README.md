## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- working with the position and background-image css properties . . . still loads to learn
- applied the BEM naming model
- fundamentals of the box model and their unique and quirky properties.

### Continued development

- weak in working with images in general . . . will have to go deeper into that.

### Useful resources

- [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend) - This helped introduce me to the fundamentals of html/css
